# Which-AI: The Intent-Based Orchestrator

Welcome to Which-AI! This is a simple but powerful skill designed to help AI agents and developers match tasks to the best Large Language Model for the job. 

Choosing the right model can be tricky. You want the highest intelligence for complex tasks, but you also want to manage your budget and respect the environment the agent is running in (like local versus cloud). Which-AI solves this by automatically routing requests based on real world data.

## What it does

Which-AI acts as a dynamic router. It takes three simple inputs:
1. **Budget:** How much are you willing to spend per million input tokens?
2. **Deployment:** Are you running this in the `cloud` or on a `local` machine?
3. **Modality:** Do you need `text`, `vision`, or `coding` capabilities?

Using these inputs, the skill checks live data from OpenRouter and community Elo scores to recommend the perfect model. If you are running locally, it even checks your system's RAM to make sure the recommended model will actually fit!

## How to use this skill

This skill is designed to be easily plugged into any agentic platform that supports markdown based skills.

### Supported Platforms
Which-AI works seamlessly with:
* Claude Code
* OpenCode
* Claude CoWork
* Any custom agent framework that supports standard skill schemas

### Adding Which-AI to your project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the `which-ai` folder into your project's skills or tools directory.
3. Make sure your agent has permission to execute bash scripts and run Python.

### Using Which-AI in Claude CoWork

Which-AI is natively structured to be a Claude CoWork plugin! Here is exactly how to install it:
1. Open your Claude CoWork environment.
2. Click the `+` icon next to the "Personal" tab in the "Browse plugins" menu.
3. Select **Add marketplace from GitHub**.
4. Enter `roeytidhar/which-ai-skill` and click **Sync**.
5. Once the marketplace is added, find the "Which ai" card and click the **Install** button.
6. Now just ask Claude: "Can you use the which-ai skill to find a coding model under $3?" and watch it work!
